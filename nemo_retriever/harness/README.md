# Retriever Harness

Developer benchmark harness for Retriever ingest/query evaluation.

The harness is artifact-first. Humans may read CLI output, but agents and
orchestrators should read `results.json`, `status.json`, and
`summary_metrics.json`.

## Quick Start

Run commands from the repository root through the `nemo_retriever` project:

```bash
uv run --project nemo_retriever retriever harness list --runsets
uv run --project nemo_retriever retriever harness show jp20_beir --json
```

Resolve a benchmark without executing ingest or queries:

```bash
uv run --project nemo_retriever retriever harness run jp20_beir \
  --dry-run \
  --output-dir /tmp/retriever-harness-dry-run \
  --json
```

Run the cheap JP20 ingest smoke check:

```bash
uv run --project nemo_retriever retriever harness run jp20_smoke \
  --output-dir /tmp/retriever-harness-jp20-smoke \
  --require 'files==20' \
  --require 'pages==1940' \
  --json
```

Run the full JP20 BEIR benchmark:

```bash
uv run --project nemo_retriever retriever harness run jp20_beir \
  --output-dir /tmp/retriever-harness-jp20-beir \
  --require 'files==20' \
  --require 'pages==1940' \
  --require 'query_count==115' \
  --require 'recall_5>=0.85' \
  --require 'ndcg_10>=0.75' \
  --json
```

Run the same JP20 BEIR request from a checked-in runfile:

```bash
uv run --project nemo_retriever retriever harness run \
  --runfile nemo_retriever/harness/runfiles/jp20_beir.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/retriever-harness-jp20-beir \
  --json
```
Run the managed Helm JP20 target without deploying:

```bash
export HARNESS_HELM_SERVICE_IMAGE_REPOSITORY=<registry>/nrl-service
export HARNESS_HELM_SERVICE_IMAGE_TAG=<immutable-main-tag>

uv run --project nemo_retriever retriever harness run \
  --runfile nemo_retriever/harness/runfiles/jp20_helm_nightly.yaml \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

The scheduled Helm session uses the same runfile and posts a top-level summary
through a channel-bound incoming webhook:

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=<secret-webhook>
nemo_retriever/harness/run_helm_nightly.sh
```

The runner deploys the checked-out chart, waits for the service and core NIMs,
ingests and queries JP20 through the service API, records service logs on
failure, and uninstalls the release. Image and Slack credentials are required
environment values and are never stored in runfiles or artifacts.


Large checked-in BEIR runfiles such as BO767, FinanceBench, Earnings, and
ViDoRe use `mode: batch`. Keep JP20 local for quick smoke validation, and use
batch mode for larger canonical quality runs so Ray-backed ingest owns worker
parallelism and memory pressure.

## Commands

- `list`: list code-owned benchmarks and optional runsets.
- `show`: inspect one benchmark definition.
- `run`: run one benchmark.
- `nightly`: execute runfiles as a session and optionally publish its Slack report.
- `run-set`: expand and run a code-owned runset.
- `diff`: compare two run artifact directories by `summary_metrics.json`.

Legacy graph-pipeline execution, sweep, runner, reporting, and portal commands
remain outside the CLI surface. The new nightly and Helm paths consume only the
artifact-first run contract.

## Reviewer Guide

Review the PR in this order:

1. Start with this README for the user-facing harness contract.
2. Read `benchmark_registry.py` for code-owned datasets, benchmarks, and
   runsets.
3. Read `resolution.py` for how registry specs, runfiles, CLI `--set`
   overrides, and mode selection become ingest/query requests.
4. Read `execution.py` for the artifact-first run lifecycle and exit-code
   behavior.
5. Read `beir_runner.py` and `metrics.py` for query evaluation and
   `summary_metrics.json` construction.
6. Read `artifact_writer.py` for artifact names, status updates, and `run.log`
   capture.
7. Read `json_io.py` for shared artifact JSON read/write helpers used by the
   harness, diff, runset, Slack, and artifact-writing paths.

Intentional removals:

- old `run.py` and `runner.py`: subprocess-oriented graph-pipeline harness
  execution and portal runner agent
- old `parsers.py`: regex parsing of stdout/progress logs
- old `reporting.py` and sweep YAML: previous stdout-oriented reporting
- old harness pytests: this harness is validated by functional benchmark
  execution and artifact/exit-code checks

The replacement `nightly.py`, Slack loader, and managed Helm execution consume
`results.json`, `summary_metrics.json`, and the current session `runs`
schema. Portal/history files remain preserved for separate repurpose work.

## Runfiles

Runfiles are a small reproducibility helper for agents, handoffs, and
orchestrators. They describe one concrete run request:

- registered `benchmark`
- optional `name`, `mode`, `run_id`, and `output_dir`
- optional `target` (`library` or `helm`)
- required `helm_config` when `target: helm`
- optional `set` overrides
- optional `require` metric gates

Runfiles cannot define new datasets or benchmarks. Add recurring benchmark
definitions to the Python registry instead.

The harness accepts JSON, YAML, or YML runfiles. Runfiles use
`schema_version: 1`; unknown top-level runfile keys fail during resolution with
exit code `2`. The checked-in JP20 example is
[`runfiles/jp20_beir.json`](runfiles/jp20_beir.json).

## Controls And Overrides

Benchmarks are code-owned defaults. Use `--set KEY=VALUE` for one-off
ablations, or put the same keys under `set` in a runfile for reproducible
agent/orchestrator runs.

Examples:

```bash
retriever harness run jp20_beir \
  --set query.top_k=20 \
  --set query.rerank=true \
  --set ingest.extract.batch.page_elements_workers=1
```

Runfile equivalent:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "benchmark": "bo767_beir",
  "mode": "batch",
  "set": {
    "query.top_k": 10,
    "ingest.extract.batch.pdf_extract_workers": 8,
    "ingest.embed.batch.embed_batch_size": 64
  }
}
```

Supported override namespaces:

- `dataset.*`: dataset path, query/qrels file, input type, BEIR loader, and
  BEIR doc ID settings.
- `ingest.*`: profile, input type, Ray mode/address, extraction/media/caption,
  dedup, chunk, embedding, image-store, storage, and batch worker settings.
- `query.*`: top-k, candidate-k, page dedup, content types, retrieval mode,
  embedding endpoint/model, reranking, LanceDB URI, and table name.
- `evaluation.*`: evaluation mode, BEIR loader/dataset/split/language/doc ID
  field, and metric cutoffs.

Unknown override keys fail during resolution with exit code `2`. Values are
parsed as YAML scalars/lists/maps, so booleans, numbers, nulls, and lists can be
passed naturally.

Use `retriever harness show <benchmark> --json` and `retriever harness run
<benchmark> --dry-run --json` to inspect the exact resolved benchmark and
plans before launching an expensive run.

## Implementation Boundary

The harness does not shell out to `retriever ingest`, `retriever query`, or
`retriever pipeline run`. It calls the same Python workflow/planning APIs used
by the CLI:

- ingest: `resolve_ingest_plan(...)` and `run_ingest_workflow(...)`
- query: `resolve_query_plan(...)` and shared query workflow objects
- BEIR: harness-owned query iteration over the resolved query plan

This keeps benchmark execution in-process at the Python boundary while still
reusing the CLI-owned request/plan/workflow seams. Stdout remains diagnostic
only; artifacts and exit codes are the contract.

## Artifacts

Read these files instead of scraping stdout:

- `results.json`: authoritative run result and artifact manifest.
- `status.json`: current/final run status, phase, and failure payload.
- `summary_metrics.json`: compact metrics for gates, dashboards, and agents.
- `events.jsonl`: phase transitions and harness events.
- `resolved_benchmark.json`: exact resolved benchmark spec.
- `ingest_plan.json`: redacted ingest dry-run plan.
- `query_plan.json`: resolved query plan.
- `environment.json`: commit and runtime context.
- `run.log`: captured lower-level stdout/stderr for non-dry execution.
- `beir_metrics.json`: BEIR metrics when BEIR evaluation executes.
- `beir_run.trec`: TREC runfile when BEIR evaluation executes.
- `query_results.jsonl`: per-query results when queries execute.

Dry-runs write only planning artifacts. They do not create empty `run.log`,
`beir_metrics.json`, `beir_run.trec`, or `query_results.jsonl` files.

## Gates

Use explicit `--require` gates. Gate expressions compare keys from
`summary_metrics.json`:

```bash
--require 'files==20'
--require 'recall_5>=0.85'
--require 'query_latency_p95_ms<=1200'
```

Gate failures exit with code `20` and still write artifacts.

During `--dry-run`, gates for unavailable execution metrics are skipped and
listed in `results.json` as `skipped_metric_gates`. Static gates such as
`files==20` and `pages==1940` are still evaluated.

Known dataset facts, observed result ranges, and suggested gates live in
[`EXPECTED_RESULTS.md`](EXPECTED_RESULTS.md). Keep threshold knowledge there,
not in benchmark Python code.

## Agent Instructions

For automated harness work:

1. Start with `retriever harness list --runsets --json`.
2. Use `retriever harness show <benchmark> --json` to inspect a benchmark.
3. Use `--output-dir` so artifact paths are deterministic.
4. Use `--dry-run` before expensive runs when changing paths, overrides, or
   gates.
5. Use explicit `--require` gates from `EXPECTED_RESULTS.md`.
6. Decide success from the process exit code and `results.json`.
7. Read `summary_metrics.json` for benchmark metrics.
8. Read `run.log` only when lower-level ingest/query logs are needed.
9. Do not parse progress bars, human CLI formatting, or raw stdout as the API.
10. Do not use `retriever pipeline run` for phase-one harness validation.

## Exit Codes

- `0`: success
- `2`: invalid benchmark/config/override/gate syntax
- `3`: dataset or input missing
- `4`: Helm deployment, readiness, or teardown failure
- `10`: ingest failure
- `11`: query failure
- `12`: evaluation failure
- `20`: metric gate failure
- `30`: artifact write failure
- `70`: unexpected internal error
